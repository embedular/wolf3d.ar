Splash images were converted from the original 320x200 paletized to wide 256x144
RGB332. That work included looking for best matches for constant background
colors, best methods for converting to RGB332, reimagining HUD positions and
more. Images herein were retouched for educational purposes only.

Each of these screens are meant to be stored on a particular CACHE SLOT in the 
embedul.ar framework storage subsystem but are not essential to run the game,
see wolf3d.ar/fs-cache/EMBEDUL.AR/CACHE/APP/WOLF3D/.
